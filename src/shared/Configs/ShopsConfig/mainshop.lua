		like GAG, the list totals to a static
		set of items
		But it comes at a selected amount.
		You can purchase it when it's in stock.
		People wait for the stock to restock
		You can force restock by paying (robux).
		So I assume it's diff for every player

		NOTFMMM the number in the list is 3.
		But it's flat out random, but limited
		to the player's level
		You can force restock by paying 1 coin
		(that is a lot early game). The scouring
		is part of the game. You control it, not
		you playing by the rules and schedules

		so i think a player/session exclusive item
		shop.
		The list is static, but stock is according
		to time.
		by Date, Hour,
